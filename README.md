# ZX Dev Tools

These are a set of build and server running scripts.

## Why does this exist?

This is sort of an experiment, but sort of a serious attempt at a tool that
provides a single point of entry to anything else. I am not creating a dev tool
stack so much as a tool to unify access to multiple dev stacks.

We'll see how it goes.

## What does it provide?

The intent is to provide a set of simple tools, including the following:

### zxpm

A project management tool aimed at aiding with Golang development and release 
handling.

### pingdb

And in an exercise of "which of these things does not belong," this is a little
tool I use to see if a MySQL server is ready to accept connections.
